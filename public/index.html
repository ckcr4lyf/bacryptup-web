                Bacryptup is an end-to-end encrypted file sharing service
            </p>
            <p>
                You can upload files either anonymously (limit 10MB per file) or with an access token (limit 100MB per
                file) <br />
                If you have an access token, your total limit is 200MB "storage" <br />
                Files uploaded are deleted after a set time in the free plans (paid plans tba)
            </p>
            <p>
                Steps to upload:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose anonymous or with an access token</li>
                    <li>Enter access token if applicable</li>
                    <li>Enter password to encrypt with (IMP: If you forget this, you will not be able to decrypt your file)</li>
                    <li>Choose the file to upload (max sure it is in the size limit)</li>
                    <li>Click upload!</li>
                </ul>
                You must take a note of the FileID that is returned to you. The FileID alone <i>cannot</i> be used to decrypt the file. The correct password must be specified as well. <br />
                There is no "link" to share files - this is intentional. Additionally, it is recommended to communicate the FileID and password over seprate channels.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymous files are deleted within 1 hour as of now</li>
                <li>"User" files (uploaded with an access token) are deleted after 24 hours</li>
                <li>"User" files may be explicitly deleted by the uploader before 24 hours, by specifying the FileID AND
                    access token</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The total combined anonymous storage limit is 2GB (as of now). If this is full, you must wait till files
                are deleted <br />
                The total combined free user storage limit is 20GB (as of now). If this is full, you must wait till
                files are deleted <br />
                Paid plans with dedicated storage will be announced soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                IMPORTANT: Restrictions are only placed on upload (access token / other plans). The downloader ONLY
                needs the FileID & Decryption Password, not the access token or anything else.

                Bacryptup uses end to end encryption to ensure no one can read / view the content of the files you
                upload.
                The password you enter is used to encrypt the files so that the server does not know the contents.
                Read on to know the exact steps that occur
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The password is converted into a AES-256bit key (and corresponding IV) using a Password-based key
                    derivation function</li>
                <li>The file is encrypted (in the browser) with this key</li>
                <li>The encrypted file and the IV is sent to the server, where the file is stored</li>
                <li>The serer returns a fileID to use to retireve the file at a later time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The password is NEVER sent to the server. Without this the server cannot decrypt or know what the file
                contents are. The fileID alone cannot be used to download and view the decrypted file, the correct
                password is necessary.

                It seems, as we make more progress and technological advances, privacy online is reducing. Companies try
                and harvest as much data as possible, often going as far as reading private messages (Facebook Messenger
                was one to do this).
                Sharing files online has always been either risky or inconvenient.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those quick anonymous upload websites work - but who knows what they do with your files? It's fine if
                maybe you want to share an mp3 or something (Dont though - its illegal).
                But if its something sensitive - such as an admission letter, or bank receipt, those websites could
                easily grab that data, even if they claim to "delete it" after 'x' time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could use a more "established" service - such as Google Drive, One Drive or just emailing. However,
                these options still don't actually encrypt the file - it may be safe from random people, though it
                Google (and other) still have the ability to view the contents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bacryptup is different - the files are encrypted <i>in your browser</i> - the server never gets a
                plaintext copy. Sure, you may think I could just make a copy? Well, even if I did (which I do not), I
                cannot read the contents, without the password. This is the beauty of end to end encryption.
                <br /><br />
                In fact, you can view the source code for the server side logic <a
                    href="https://github.com/ckcr4lyf/bacryptup-server">here.</a> (Sorry if it's messy, the codebase
                hasn't been polished yet.)

                Bacryptup is in a beta stage. Functionality is not perfect, and uptime is not guaranteed. You've been
                warned.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "anonymous" version can upload files upto 10MB and uses the shared space of total 2GB. If you use an
                access token instead, you get the following benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>100MB single file limit</li>
                    <li>20GB shared space</li>
                    <li>200MB storage limit per user / access token</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Having an access token is mostly useful to share slightly larger files, rather than anonymous mode.
                Higher volume plans may be introduced later.
            </p>
